### Section 6: Trade Setups (3 Scenarios)

#### **Setup 1: Aggressive Long (Current Entry)**
```markdown
| Parameter | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Entry | $257-260 | 200 MA support, 0.236 Fib, inverse H&S forming |
| Stop Loss | $248 | -4.3% risk, below 200 MA + channel support |
| Target 1 | $272 | +4.6%, 50 MA reclaim, R:R 1:1.5 |
| Target 2 | $285 | +10%, ATH test, R:R 1:3.0 |
| Target 3 | $295 | +14%, analyst PT zone, R:R 1:4.2 |
| Position Size | 1-2% risk | Standard for high-conviction setup |
| Confidence | 70% | Historical precedent strong, but proximity to breakdown |
```

**Action Plan:**
1. Enter 50% at $258-260 (current area)
2. Add 25% on dip to $253-255 (if offered)
3. Add final 25% on breakout above $265 (confirmation)
4. Take 30% profit at Target 1, move stop to breakeven
5. Take 40% at Target 2, trail remaining 30%

#### **Setup 2: Conservative Long (Breakout Confirmation)**
```markdown
| Parameter | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Entry | $270-272 | Breakout above 50 MA + H&S neckline |
| Stop Loss | $258 | -4.8% risk, back below neckline |
| Target 1 | $285 | +5.5%, ATH zone, R:R 1:1.3 |
| Target 2 | $295 | +9.2%, measured move, R:R 1:2.1 |
| Position Size | 2-3% risk | Lower risk after confirmation |
| Confidence | 85% | Confirmed breakout reduces risk |
```

#### **Setup 3: Breakdown Short (IF $250 Fails)**
```markdown
| Parameter | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Entry | $247-249 | Break below 200 MA on volume |
| Stop Loss | $255 | -2.8% risk, reclaim of 200 MA |
| Target 1 | $243 | -2%, 0.382 Fib, R:R 1:1 |
| Target 2 | $235 | -5%, gap fill, R:R 1:2.5 |
| Position Size | 1% risk | Lower probability (fundamentals strong) |
| Confidence | 40% | Counter-trend trade, fundamentals don't support |
```

### Section 7: Technical Bias & Conviction

**BULLISH** - 70% Confidence

**Bull Case (Why Long Here):**
1. ✅ **200 MA support holding** (0.71% above) - critical long-term level
2. ✅ **Inverse H&S pattern** forming - 68% historical success rate
3. ✅ **Volume accumulation** - 97% spike on positive day
4. ✅ **RSI neutral** (48.44) - room to run to 70+ before overbought
5. ✅ **Bollinger squeeze** - volatility compression signals breakout
6. ✅ **Historical precedent** - Last setup like this rallied 32% (Oct 2023)

**Bear Case (Risks to Watch):**
1. ⚠️ **Below 50 MA** (-3.29%) - short-term weakness
2. ⚠️ **MACD bearish cross** - momentum negative
3. ⚠️ **Potential death cross** - 50 MA approaching 200 MA
4. ⚠️ **10% off ATH** - momentum lost
5. ⚠️ **Tepid earnings reaction** - market skeptical despite record results

**What Changes the Thesis:**
- **Bullish invalidation:** Break below $248 on volume >70M → target $240-243
- **Bullish confirmation:** Break above $270 on volume >60M → target $285-295
