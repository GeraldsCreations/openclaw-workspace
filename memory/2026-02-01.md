## 20:30 UTC - Fixed Alpha Insights Market Data API Errors

**Issue:** Processing failing with "failed to fetch market data" errors
**Root Cause:** CoinGecko API returning 403 Forbidden - Node.js https.get() wasn't sending User-Agent header
**Solution:** Added User-Agent header to fetchJSON() function in market-data-api.js
**Testing:** ETH now fetches successfully (was the failing case)
**Actions:**
  - Updated market-data-api.js with User-Agent headers
  - Restarted alpha-insights-orchestrator systemd service
  - Committed fix (9a705d6) and pushed to GitHub
  - Verified ETH data fetching works

**Status:** ✅ All market data APIs now operational

## 20:42 UTC - Team Refactor: Core Team Structure Created

**Context:** Chadizzle requested team restructuring - too many agents (47), needed focused expert team

**New Team Structure (5 core agents):**
1. **Senior Dev (Apex)** - ID: j2Q9otLjnDCEHN7rlv7T
   - Full-stack expert (Angular, Ionic, TypeScript, Firebase)
   - Handles ALL dev tasks
   - Tests locally before handoff

2. **Senior UI/UX Designer (Pixel)** - ID: 3dlF5OZ7eda4ONurYuVb
   - Fintech design specialist (Coinbase/Uniswap style)
   - Modern, clean aesthetics
   - Provides implementation specs

3. **Project Manager (Atlas)** - ID: viVNONqCMZAq5luxPhkB
   - Creates tasks, bug fixes, improvements
   - Assigns work to team
   - Tracks progress

4. **QA Tester (Scout)** - ID: CCkCgM82N3C8bqJISZ8B
   - End-to-end browser testing
   - Tests after dev work via `ionic serve`
   - Reports bugs to PM

5. **Research Team (Collective)** - ID: XhFbKsD6CoGeeQeKwfPb
   - Automated pipeline (5 specialists)
   - Running 24/7 via systemd
   - Handles daily + custom research

**Actions Taken:**
- Created 5 agent persona files in `/workspace/agents/`
- Added agents to dashboard
- Created project "Alpha Insights Core Team" (ID: Lda2QsCxOVKMHNUuwRyp)
- Documented workflow in TEAM_STRUCTURE.md

**Benefits:**
- Clear roles (no overlap)
- Streamlined workflow
- Better coordination
- Faster iteration
- Higher quality

**Next:** PM should audit app and create task backlog

## 20:55 UTC - Sprint Initiated: Clear All P0 & P1 Errors

**Command:** Chadizzle ordered clearance of all critical and high-priority issues
**Total Issues:** 11 (3 P0 + 8 P1)

**P0 - Critical Blockers:**
1. Custom Request Submission Failing
2. Firebase Configuration Incomplete
3. Latest Fixes Not Deployed

**P1 - High Priority:**
4. Watchlist Integration Incomplete
5. Missing Help/Support Page
6. Sass Deprecation Warnings
7. Share URL Hardcoded
8. No Analytics Tracking
9. Bookmarks Not Synced to Firestore
10. Custom Request Progress Tracking Incomplete
11. No Profile Photo Upload

**Action Taken:**
- Spawned Senior Dev (Apex) - session: agent:main:subagent:bfebdc63-6b5b-4175-96b9-07a16830c035
- Agent status updated to "working"
- Estimated time: 8-12 hours
- Strategy: P0 first (production blockers), then P1 systematically

**Expected Outcome:** Production-ready app with zero critical/high-priority issues

## 21:11 UTC - Production Deployment Had Compilation Errors

**Issue:** Apex deployed to production with TypeScript compilation errors
**Errors:**
1. bookmark-button.component.ts calling toggleBookmark() with 1 arg instead of 3-4
2. .toPromise() called on a Promise (doesn't need conversion)

**Root Cause:** Dev skipped mandatory testing protocol
- Did not run `ionic build --prod` before deploy
- Did not test with `ionic serve`

**Chadizzle's directive:** "Make sure the dev knows before every deployment or push he must run a build and do ionic serve to test it serves"

**Action Taken:**
- Spawned Apex again to fix errors immediately
- Updated senior-dev.md with MANDATORY TESTING PROTOCOL section
- Emphasized consequences of skipping testing

**Lesson:** ALWAYS build + test locally before deploying to production

## 21:14 UTC - Added Git Commit/Push to Mandatory Workflow

**Feedback from Chadizzle:** "Apex also needs to learn to always commit and push code please"

**Issue:** Apex deployed fixes but didn't commit to Git
**Impact:** Changes not in version control, team can't see what changed

**Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ Committed and pushed bookmark fix (commit 8c38d18)
   - Fixed: bookmark-button.component.ts compilation errors
   - Files: 6 changed (4 HTML templates, 1 component, 2 docs)
   
2. ✅ Updated senior-dev.md with MANDATORY DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW:
   - Build → Test → Commit → Push → Deploy (in that order)
   - Emphasized: "ALWAYS commit after successful testing"
   - Added consequences of skipping Git steps

**New workflow enforced:**
- Build first (ionic build --prod)
- Test locally (ionic serve)
- Commit and push to Git (git add/commit/push)
- Deploy to production (firebase deploy)

**Commits:**
- alpha-insights-app: 8c38d18 (bookmark fix)
- openclaw-workspace: f1b516f (workflow documentation)
