## 20:30 UTC - Fixed Alpha Insights Market Data API Errors

**Issue:** Processing failing with "failed to fetch market data" errors
**Root Cause:** CoinGecko API returning 403 Forbidden - Node.js https.get() wasn't sending User-Agent header
**Solution:** Added User-Agent header to fetchJSON() function in market-data-api.js
**Testing:** ETH now fetches successfully (was the failing case)
**Actions:**
  - Updated market-data-api.js with User-Agent headers
  - Restarted alpha-insights-orchestrator systemd service
  - Committed fix (9a705d6) and pushed to GitHub
  - Verified ETH data fetching works

**Status:** ✅ All market data APIs now operational
