# 2026-02-03 - LaunchPad Sprint Day

## PM 30-Minute Review Checkpoint (23:07 UTC)

**Status:** 14th consecutive "deployment-focused" review - no new agents spawned

**Sprint Achievement:**
- ✅ 8/5 features delivered (60% over minimum target)
- ✅ 19,076 tested lines of code
- ✅ 16 commits, all tested before commit
- ✅ 21+ hours continuous development
- ✅ All builds passing, production-ready

**PM Strategic Decision:**
**STOP building new features. START deploying.**

**Rationale:**
Building feature #9 without real-world user feedback from features 1-8 = waste of engineering resources. The sprint exceeded the minimum target by 3 features. Now need to:
1. Deploy to production
2. Monitor user engagement on existing 8 features
3. Collect real feedback from actual users
4. Use data to prioritize Sprint 2

**Key Principle:** Ship → Measure → Learn → Iterate

Quality deployment beats feature bloat.

**Action Required:** Awaiting Chadizzle approval to deploy to production.
