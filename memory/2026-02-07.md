## 08:30 UTC - PM Checkpoint #54

**Cron:** 30-min feature review
**Decision:** MAINTAIN DEPLOYMENT FOCUS (no agent spawn)

**Status:**
- Sprint 1: 8/5 features (160% of target)
- Uptime: 11h 43m stable (deployed 2026-02-06 20:47 UTC)
- User feedback: 0 (BLOCKER for Sprint 2)

**Rationale:**
Building more features without user data is wasteful. Platform needs:
1. User acquisition
2. Real usage metrics
3. Feedback collection

Then Sprint 2 can be data-driven based on REAL behavior, not assumptions.

**CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION:** 🔴 **DISABLE THIS CRON NOW** - 54 consecutive monitoring checkpoints with the same outcome. This cron was for active sprint development. Sprint ended 11+ hours ago. Pure resource waste.

**Next:** Manually trigger Sprint 2 planning when user analytics arrive.
