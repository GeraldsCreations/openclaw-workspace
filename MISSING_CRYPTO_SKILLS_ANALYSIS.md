## 🎯 What Should We Build First?

**For quick revenue:** Token Launcher (2-3 weeks, immediate income)  
**For sustainable business:** Smart Money Tracker (4-6 weeks, recurring)  
**For massive upside:** Airdrop Farmer (4-6 weeks, success-based)

**My recommendation:** Build Token Launcher first (get to revenue fast), then Smart Money Tracker (build recurring base), then Airdrop Farmer (swing for the fences).

## 🔮 Future Trends to Watch

1. **Intent-based trading** (user says "I want 100 BONK", bot finds best route)
2. **AI agents trading autonomously** (x402 protocol we researched earlier)
3. **Social trading** (TikTok/YouTube influencers → auto-copy trades)
4. **RWA tokenization tools** (create tokens backed by real assets)
5. **Prediction market automation** (auto-bet on Polymarket based on odds)

---

**Bottom line:** There's easily $1M+/year opportunity in missing crypto skills. Start with Token Launcher (fast revenue), scale with Smart Money Tracker (recurring), and swing big with Airdrop Farmer (high upside).
