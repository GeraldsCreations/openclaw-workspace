## 🎲 Risk Analysis

### Custom Contract Risks
- ❌ **Smart contract bugs** → Mitigate with $50K audits
- ❌ **3-month dev timeline** → Slower to market
- ❌ **Maintenance costs** → $5K-10K/month ongoing
- ✅ **But:** Full control, 2.3x revenue, no protocol dependencies

### Meteora Risks
- ❌ **Revenue cap** → Limited to 0.3-0.5% fees sustainably
- ❌ **Protocol dependency** → Meteora could change fees/terms
- ❌ **Competitive pressure** → Everyone uses same pools
- ✅ **But:** Fast to market (2-4 weeks), proven infrastructure

## 🏆 Recommendation: Hybrid Strategy

### Phase 1: Meteora MVP (Months 1-3)
- ✅ Launch in 2-4 weeks
- ✅ Validate product-market fit
- ✅ Generate $150K-500K revenue
- ✅ Use revenue to fund custom development

### Phase 2: Build Custom (Months 4-6)
- ✅ Develop bonding curve contracts
- ✅ Run security audits
- ✅ Parallel test while Meteora live

### Phase 3: Switch to Custom (Month 6+)
- ✅ Migrate to custom contracts
- ✅ 2.3x revenue multiplier kicks in
- ✅ Keep Meteora as fallback

**Why Hybrid Works:**
1. **Fastest time-to-market** (revenue in 3-4 weeks)
2. **Revenue funds development** (self-financing)
3. **Reduced risk** (proven model first)
4. **Best of both worlds** (speed + profitability)

4. **LP Fee Sharing**: Optional 10-30% of LP fees post-graduation
5. **Custom Features**: Anti-snipe, vesting, dynamic curves, token gating
6. **No Dependencies**: Meteora can't change terms, cut you off, or raise fees
7. **Brand Differentiation**: Your tech, your rules, your moat
